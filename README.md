This is the repository for Ethnicity and gender prediction project.

This project is done by me, Thang Bui Doan, under instruction of Prof. Michelangelo Rossi, Telecom Paris.


### Introduction

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has had a profound impact on economies worldwide, and the tourism and hospitality industry, including companies like Airbnb, has experienced significant disruptions. The pandemic brought travel restrictions, lockdown measures, and a decline in consumer confidence, leading to a sharp decline in tourism and travel demand. Apart from that, the COVID-19 also caused a wave of discrimination towards Asian-Americans [1]. In order to adapt to the circumstance, AirBnB adapted numerous policies, such as flexible cancellations, promoting local tourism, detecting and preventing discriminations. To accomplish the last goal, the first step is to be able to predict a personâ€™s gender and ethnicity. 

In this project, we use available methods to predict gender and ethnicity of AirBnB guests from available provided data. I hope the result of this project can help us resolve part of the problem, which is gender and race discrimination, whether the world is plague with a epidemic or not.
